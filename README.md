# Microbiome_Fungi

Codes and Data to reproduce the results of "Fungal Communities as Indicators of Soil Health: Land-Use and Climate Effects in Mediterranean and Semi-Arid Agroecosystems” by Y. Steinberg et al. (submitted)

The repository contains:
- `SoilHealth-Fungi_mod.xlsx` -> complete raw dataset
- `pca_rda.ipynb` -> jupyter notebook (in R) that performs PCA and RDA analysis on the phyla abundances
- `pictures_for_paper.ipynb` -> jupyter notebook (in python) to reproduce all the relevant pictures and tables to include in the manuscript
- `network_analysis.ipynb` -> jupyter notebook that perform network analysis of genera communities based on correlation between genera
- `funguild.ipynb` -> jupyter notebook that used the FUNguild database to classify the genera in our dataset into functional fungal guilds.
